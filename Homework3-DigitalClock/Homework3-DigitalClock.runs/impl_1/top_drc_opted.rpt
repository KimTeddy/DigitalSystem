2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT clock_inst/hrs1[3]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
clock_inst/hrs1_reg[0], clock_inst/hrs1_reg[1], clock_inst/hrs1_reg[2]
clock_inst/hrs1_reg[3]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT clock_inst/min0_ovf is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
clock_inst/min1_reg[0], clock_inst/min1_reg[1], clock_inst/min1_reg[2]
clock_inst/min1_reg[3]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#3 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT clock_inst/min1_ovf is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
clock_inst/hrs0_reg[0], clock_inst/hrs0_reg[1], clock_inst/hrs0_reg[2]
clock_inst/hrs0_reg[3]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#4 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT clock_inst/sec0_ovf is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
clock_inst/sec1_reg[0], clock_inst/sec1_reg[1], clock_inst/sec1_reg[2]
clock_inst/sec1_reg[3]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#5 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT clock_inst/sec1_ovf is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
clock_inst/min0_reg[0], clock_inst/min0_reg[1], clock_inst/min0_reg[2]
clock_inst/min0_reg[3]
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
