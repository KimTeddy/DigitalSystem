PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net clock_inst/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clock_inst/dec_out_reg[6]_i_2/O, cell clock_inst/dec_out_reg[6]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net clock_inst/hrs1[3]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clock_inst/hrs1[3]_i_2/O, cell clock_inst/hrs1[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net clock_inst/min0_ovf__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clock_inst/min0_ovf/O, cell clock_inst/min0_ovf. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net clock_inst/min1_ovf__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clock_inst/min1_ovf/O, cell clock_inst/min1_ovf. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net clock_inst/sec0_ovf__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clock_inst/sec0_ovf/O, cell clock_inst/sec0_ovf. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
